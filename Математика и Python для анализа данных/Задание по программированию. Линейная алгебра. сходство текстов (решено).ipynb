      "0___In comparison to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process.\n",
      "\n",
      "1___As cat simply catenates streams of bytes, it can be also used to concatenate binary files, where it will just concatenate sequence of bytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2___A common interactive use of cat for a single file is to output the content of a file to standard output.\n",
      "\n",
      "3___Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "4___In one, people deliberately tamed cats in a process of artificial selection, as they were useful predators of vermin.\n",
      "\n",
      "5___The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6___Domestic cats are similar in size to the other members of the genus Felis, typically weighing between 4 and 5 kg (8.8 and 11.0 lb).\n",
      "\n",
      "7___However, if the output is piped or redirected, cat is unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "8___cat with one named file is safer where human error is a concern - one wrong use of the default redirection symbol \">\" instead of \"<\" (often adjacent on keyboards) may permanently delete the file you were just needing to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "9___In terms of legibility, a sequence of commands starting with cat and connected by pipes has a clear left-to-right flow of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "10___Cat command is one of the basic commands that you learned when you started in the Unix / Linux world.\n",
      "\n",
      "11___Using cat command, the lines received from stdin can be redirected to a new file using redirection symbols.\n",
      "\n",
      "12___When you type simply cat command without any arguments, it just receives the stdin content and displays it in the stdout.\n",

      "13___Leopard was released on October 26, 2007 as the successor of Tiger (version 10.4), and is available in two editions.\n",
      "\n",
      "14___According to Apple, Leopard contains over 300 changes and enhancements over its predecessor, Mac OS X Tiger.\n",
      "\n",
      "15___As of Mid 2010, some Apple computers have firmware factory installed which will no longer allow installation of Mac OS X Leopard.\n",
      "\n",
      "16___Since Apple moved to using Intel processors in their computers, the OSx86 community has developed and now also allows Mac OS X Tiger and later releases to be installed on non-Apple x86-based computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "17___OS X Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012 for purchase and download through Apple's Mac App Store, as part of a switch to releasing OS X versions online and every year.\n",
      "\n",
      "18___Apple has released a small patch for the three most recent versions of Safari running on OS X Yosemite, Mavericks, and Mountain Lion.\n",
      "\n",
      "19___The Mountain Lion release marks the second time Apple has offered an incremental upgrade, rather than releasing a new cat entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "20___Mac OS X Mountain Lion installs in place, so you won't need to create a separate disk or run the installation off an external drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "21___The fifth major update to Mac OS X, Leopard, contains such a mountain of features - more than 300 by Apple's count.\n",
